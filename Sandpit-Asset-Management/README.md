# Sandpit: Asset Management

The **Sandpit-Asset-Management** folder contains both the managed and unmanaged versions of my **Sandpit: Asset Management** solution. This project is the outcome of following Lisa Crosbie's excellent YouTube tutorial, titled [Power Apps Model Driven Apps FULL COURSE for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/embed/LIC8DFW8fOE?si=5ehRzHkt1KrTolr-), where she provides detailed instructions on how to build a Model Driven App and its supporting components.

## What's Included?

- **Managed Version:** An optimised version of the Sandpit: Asset Management solution, ready for deployment in various environments.
- **Unmanaged Version:** Dive into the code and configurations, explore the inner workings of the solution, and customise it to fit your unique needs.

## What's Not Included?

The solution does not include the Power BI Report or Dashboard. Please watch Lisa Crosbie's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/embed/LIC8DFW8fOE?si=5ehRzHkt1KrTolr-) on how to configure the Power BI Report or Dashboard for this solution.
