# Sandpit: Shared Assets

The sandpit consists of two solutions:

1. **Sandpit: Shared Assets** - contains the shared Component Library.
2. **Sandpit: Canvas App** - contains a Canvas app to test the process of sharing a Component Library within an environment.

## Background

A couple of months had passed since I last developed a Canvas App and Components, and I was having trouble adding custom components. All because Microsoft had updated the UI without their annoying prompts or tips.

## Solution

The **Get more components** has moved and has become a **small icon** near the top of the **Insert** menu, below the Search and Filter tools.

Based on memory, the rest of the process has stayed the same.
