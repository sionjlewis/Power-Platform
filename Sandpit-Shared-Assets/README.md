# Sandpit: Shared Assets

The sandpit consists of two solutions:

1. **Sandpit: Shared Assets** - contains the shared Component Library.
2. **Sandpit: Canvas App** - contains a canvas app for test the process of sharing a Component Library within an environment.

> Watch this space, I have not published the **Sandpit: Canvas App** at this stage.
